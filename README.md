Meet Simon, a futuristic post-apocalypse artificial intelligence charged with guarding man's most precious gateway, and whose only source of inspiration for doing so is a 1980s inventory list from Macy's toy department.

## Making changes

Simon uses Sass as a CSS preprocessor. Here are the [installation instructions](https://sass-lang.com/install) and the [usage reference](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#using_sass).

Watch changes to the Sass files with: 

```
sass --watch sass/style.sass:static/css/style.css
```

Compile the Sass files to compressed CSS with:

```
sass sass/style.sass:static/css/style.css --style compressed
```
